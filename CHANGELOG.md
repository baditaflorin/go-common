# Changelog

All notable changes to `github.com/baditaflorin/go-common` are recorded here.
Versioning follows semver on the git-tag axis; the package itself has no
embedded version string (consumers pin via `go.mod`).

## v0.36.0 — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **`safehttp.NewClient` now honors the `FLEET_REQUIRE_PROXY=1`
  environment variable as a fleet-wide proxy-egress enforcement
  switch.** When the env var is set to a truthy value
  (`1` / `true` / `yes`, case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed) and
  the caller did NOT explicitly opt out with `WithoutProxy()`,
  `NewClient` behaves as if `RequireProxy()` was passed — panicking
  at startup if no `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` env var is set.

  This closes the silent-fallback hole behind the **2026-05-21
  Hetzner abuse complaint**, where five fleet tools
  (`go_security_headers`, `go_social_graph`, `go_revenue_model`,
  `go_cookie_checker`, `go-url-categorizer-enrichment`) leaked the
  dockerhost IP `176.9.123.221` against external bug-bounty
  targets. All five had `proxy_egress: true` set in `service.yaml`
  and were calling `safehttp.NewClient()` (without
  `RequireProxy()`), so when `/opt/_shared/proxy.env` failed to
  mount or `HTTPS_PROXY` was otherwise unset at container start,
  `http.ProxyFromEnvironment` silently fell back to direct egress.
  The abuse log showed every UA string matching our own tools
  hitting external sites from the gateway IP.

  Paired with `go_fleet_runner ≥ <pending>`, which renders
  `FLEET_REQUIRE_PROXY=1` into the per-service `.env` for every
  service with `proxy_egress: true`. Together they convert silent
  direct-egress into a loud startup panic that the deploy smoke
  gate catches.

  `WithoutProxy()` still wins so SSRF probers, smuggling tests,
  and port scanners that legitimately need direct egress (and pass
  `WithoutProxy()` explicitly) are unaffected.

  No API surface change. Callers that don't have
  `FLEET_REQUIRE_PROXY` in their env continue to behave identically
  to v0.35.0 — fully backwards-compatible.

## v0.35.0 — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **`safehttp.WithUserAgent` now actually overrides the outbound
  User-Agent header.** Pre-fix, the option stored the string but
  only the redirect-follow path (`Client.CheckRedirect`) ever
  applied it — every INITIAL request from every fleet caller went
  out with Go's default `Go-http-client/1.1`. Upstreams that gate
  on UA (Wikidata WDQS T400119 was the canary; many CDNs and
  GitHub APIs do the same) silently 403'd against us. This is a
  fleet-wide behavioral fix: every Go service that calls
  `safehttp.NewClient(safehttp.WithUserAgent(ua.Build(slug, ver)))`
  will, after `go get -u`, start sending the configured UA on
  every outbound request instead of the Go default.

  The fix wraps a UA-injecting `http.RoundTripper` into the
  transport chain inside `NewClient`, layered AFTER the SSRF guard
  and the extras/observer transports so the new wrapper does not
  alter SSRF semantics. Per-request UA override is preserved: if a
  caller does `req.Header.Set("User-Agent", "...")` before the
  call, that value wins (the wrapper only injects when the header
  is unset). The injected UA also survives 302 redirect follows.

  No API surface change. Callers that were not passing
  `WithUserAgent` continue to send Go's default UA — backwards-
  compatible for opt-out callers.
